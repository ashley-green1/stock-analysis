# Green Stock Analysis

## Project Overview

### Background
Steve asked me to analyze a group of 12 green stocks to support his parent’s investment decisions.  To do so, I gladly designed an interactive, user friendly, workbook using Visual Basic Application (VBA) within Excel to provide each stocks annual volume and return on investment (ROI).

He loved being able to analyze each stock at the click of a button and now wants to expand his research beyond the 12 green stocks.

  

### Purpose
Steve wants to analyze a higher number of stocks and I am here to help.  This may increase the amount of time it takes the analysis to produce results and I’d like to maintain or, even better, improve it!  Now I will take advantage of any opportunity to improve the workbooks efficiency by refactoring the VBA coding.  To ensure that I am going in the right direction, I will compare the new execution time with the original workbook.

## 2)Results

### Refactoring the Code

To make my code more efficient, I created 3 new arrays:
-tickerVolumes(12) to hold volume
-tickerStartingPrices(12) to hold starting price
-tickerEndingPrices(12) to hold ending price

The above 3 arrays store performance data for each stock when a for loop runs analysis on them. The tickers array that I created in the original establishes a ticker symbol that can be called on for each stock.

Matching the 3 performance arrays with the ticker array is done by using a variable called the tickerIndex.

Now that I have created these arrays, I can use Nested For Loops and variables to loop through the data and complete the analysis. 

See the Refactored vs Original coding below.
